depends on your project in DonateGiverTaskManager.java

before the for loop example: "for (Player activeChar : World.getPlayer(obj_id))" 

adapt (again depends on your project) add before the for loop this:
Player Player = World.getPlayer(obj_id);
if (Player != null && Player.isOnline() == true)

so it will become like this
Player Player = World.getPlayer(obj_id);
if (Player != null && Player.isOnline() == true)
   for (Player activeChar : World.getPlayer(obj_id))
   // rest of code
